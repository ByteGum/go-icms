# Go mLayer

* The go implementation decentralized chain agnostic mLayer protocol

* mLayer (message layer) is an open, decentralized communication network that enables the creation, transmission and termination of data of all sizes, leveraging modern protocols. mLayer is a comprehensive suite of communication protocols designed to evolve with the ever-advancing realm of cryptography. Given its protocol-centric nature, it is an adaptable and universally integrable tool conceived for the decentralized era.

# Building Go mLayer

## Automated Build
* Coming Soon
## Manual Build
* [Download and install Go](https://go.dev/dl/). Go mLayer has been tested with Go 1.19.*
* Clone the go-mlayer repository
* Rename the config.sample file in the root direct of the go-mlayer repo.
* Replace the configuration parameters.

# Running Go mLayer
* You will need to stake some mLT (or TmLT on the testnet) to run a validator node
* You must provide the public key of your nodes 'network_private_key' when staking your mLT
